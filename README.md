# Project Description
The University of Washington(UW) is a large and expansive campus with a variety of buildings that many students will never have a reason to visit. Many of these buildings are home to study spaces that go untouched or remain a secret to only a handful of students at a time. We want to make the knowledge of these study spaces accessible to all UW students. Although study spaces such as Odegaard and Suzzallo Allen Libraries are great and are home to many students’ study sessions throughout the year, they do not come without their drawbacks, such as overcrowdedness, noise levels, and proximity to other buildings. We do not believe a tool where it aggregates all the study areas within the UW under one site exists. Thus, as developers as well as graduating students, we would like to pass these gems of the university to the younger generation.

| P0       | As a Student  | I’m currently in between classes in North Campus and need a space where they are charging ports, open between 10 - 12 AM, and is relatively quiet.                                                                                                | We want to be able to query our database for what they are looking for. Ability to navigate our UI quickly. Allow the user to view the list of study spaces. The dev team initially fills the database with some study spaces along with fields such as locations, times, descriptions, restrictions etc. The comments and rating will be empty at this point. We will use the query parameter to look for keywords according to the user's request. The user will make a fetch GET request to the endpoint /room/specific?[query parameters], which will fetch study spaces data matching the parameters from our mongoDB database and return it as a JSON object. If no query parameter was given and the requests was made through /room/,, then the server will return all study space. For this user story, the GET request would be /room/specific?location=North+Campus&timeMin=10&timeMax=12&quiet=relatively.The getting a response object from the /room/specific?[query parameters] GET requests, the client side will iterate through the JSON object and generate a view of the study space on the client’s browser.                                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| P1       | As a student  | I happened to find a pretty sweet study room in North Campus and would like to share it with my peers.                                                                                                                                            | I want to let my fellow peers know about this new spaces by logging in to verify that I am in fact a UW student and I have used the study space and then create and submit a post regarding a new study space that is not already listed in the database. Ability to post new spaces that will be added to our mongoDB database. Include required input such as, location, restrictions, times the building is open, and a description.Each posting of a new study space will requires a POST request /room/ endpoint. The body of post requests will include location, the open time, the closing time, description, quiet level, and charging options. If the room added to the mongoDB database if it is not already listed and the Post request will return a JSON with {status: success}, else it will return {status: failure, exception: room already in listed}. Client code will reload if status was success, else will stay on the input form and display the exception messageThe dev team will allow the user to log into the server as a UW student using Azure authentication. Then we will save the users post input to the database of study spaces. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Students must first login through Azure authentication. The updating of a study room will be done through a PUT request at the end point /room/update . The body of the PUT request will have the properties to be updated. The server will take the request body and send an update call to the mongoDB database to alter the study space.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

This will only be possible for users that have successfully login. The dev team will once again allow the user to log into the server as a UW student using Azure authentication. Then we will save the review created by the user. This will be through the POST request to /room/comment endpoint with the Post body containing the fields post, rating number, and description. The field post contains the objectId of the pre-existing post which it is associated with.

Only the poster of that comment can delete it. Student must first be login through Azure Authentication, and then sent a POST request to the /room/uncomment endpoint. The Post body must contain the id of the comment. The server will delete a comment from our mongoDB database that matches the commentId and username from the user current session.
